Maths Compiler with GUI Interface

This project implements a complete arithmetic expression compiler with a graphical user interface (GUI). The compiler can handle mathematical expressions, generate intermediate code (postfix), produce three-address code (TAC), and compute the final result. It includes both backend and frontend components, ensuring modularity and scalability.
